# Business Analyst Case Study: Legacy Data Migration

_A project focused on ensuring traceability, compliance, and access during legacy system decommissioning._

# Legacy System Data Migration to Internal Archive

## Overview  
This project involved the end-to-end definition of business and functional requirements for migrating legacy insurance data from an internal mainframe system to a read-only archival repository.  
It was part of a broader digital transformation initiative by a leading European insurance group, aimed at decommissioning outdated platforms while ensuring historical data remains accessible for regulatory, legal, and operational needs.  
_Company and system names have been modified to protect confidentiality._

## Business Problem  
The company needed to retire an aging policy administration system but retain access to decades of customer, financial, and policy records.  
These records are critical for ongoing claims processing, audits, compliance, and legal inquiries.  
The project focused on migrating inactive data from the legacy system (“HUON”) into an internal archive (“Repo”), while ensuring data integrity, traceability, and compliance throughout.

## My Role  
As Business Analyst, I was responsible for:

- Defining the functional scope and business rules for the data migration  
- Mapping business entities (customers, policies, transactions) to archive structures  
- Documenting referential integrity and validation logic  
- Collaborating with technical teams to translate business logic into executable queries  
- Supporting access governance and role definition for downstream systems  
- Coordinating with stakeholders in legal, compliance, and claims teams  
- Identifying open points and managing business-side sign-offs  

## Tools and Methods  

- Business analysis  
- Data migration frameworks  
- Functional requirement specification  
- Stakeholder interviews and workshops  
- Validation rule design  
- Jira (task and issue tracking)  
- Excel (mapping and matrix definition)  
- PDF documentation (functional specs)  

## Project Steps  

1. Defined data migration scope with business units  
2. Identified data categories to archive and discard  
3. Specified business rules for customer and policy selection  
4. Documented referential integrity and completeness criteria  
5. Structured the pre-migration validation process  
6. Supported data transformation rules (minimal, format-aligned only)  
7. Coordinated access roles for multiple departments  
8. Drafted rollback strategy and escalation paths  
9. Listed open points requiring governance or legal sign-off  

## Deliverables  

- Functional Requirements Specification (PDF)  
- Policy and transaction data mapping rules  
- Role-based access matrix  
- Validation logic and business rule definitions  
- Business-side rollback criteria  
- Governance checklist for compliance and legal  

## Results and Impact  

- Enabled secure retirement of legacy system with no data loss  
- Ensured full historical traceability for legal and audit use  
- Aligned migration outcomes with cross-department business needs  
- Provided a reusable model for future archival migrations  
- Significantly reduced reliance on live systems for historical queries  

## What I Learned  

- How to scope and drive a high-stakes migration project with multiple departments  
- Designing business rules that translate clearly to technical implementation  
- Coordinating access governance across claims, legal, and finance  

## How Others Can Learn from This  

Anyone working on data migration from legacy systems—especially in regulated sectors—can use this case to:

- Understand how to structure business-led migration  
- Design compliance-aligned validation rules  
- Collaborate with technical teams while maintaining functional clarity
